given an infinite 2d grid labeled with a spiral as such

|    |    |    |    |    |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 |
| 18 |  5 |  4 |  3 | 12 |
| 19 |  6 |  1 |  2 | 11 |
| 20 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 |
| 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |

find the manhatten distance between the square labeled with n and 1

eg:
* 1 is 0 away from 1
* 12 is 3 away from 1
* 23 is 2 away from 1
* 1024 is 31 away from 1
